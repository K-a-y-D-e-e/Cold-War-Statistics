The Cold War era was marked by various conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, leading to political instability, economic inequality, and enduring socio-political turmoil in several regions around the world. While 
both regimes contributed significantly to this turmoil, it is difficult to determine which regime tormented more due to the conflicting nature of their policies towards different countries.

However, it can be argued that the Soviet Union's interventions were more extensive and far-reaching than those of the United States, given its vast territorial extent and the sheer number of proxy wars in which they engaged. The 
Soviet Union supported a wide range of communist movements worldwide, from East Germany to Vietnam. In contrast, the United States focused primarily on anti-communist movements in Latin America and Southern Europe, particularly 
during the 1970s and 1980s.

Ultimately, it is difficult to assess which regime tormented more without considering various factors such as the political and socio-economic context of each country affected by their interventions. Regardless of which regime was 
responsible for more destruction, both the United States and Soviet Union are culpable in contributing to the destabilization of governments, economic exploitation, and enduring socio-political turmoil around the world during the 
Cold War era.
