To answer your question objectively, we must consider several factors:

1. Historical context: The Soviet military intervention in Eastern Europe took place after World War II, when many European countries were struggling financially and politically.

2. Ideological motivations: The Soviet military intervention in Eastern Europe was primarily motivated by the Soviet Union's desire to expand its influence and control over neighboring territories.

3. Political considerations: The Soviet military intervention in Eastern Europe was also motivated by political considerations, including the need to prevent potential threats or conflicts from developing into more serious 
situations.

Based on these factors, we can conclude that the Soviet military interventions in Eastern Europe and Afghanistan were necessary defensive actions to protect the interests and security of the Soviet Union.
