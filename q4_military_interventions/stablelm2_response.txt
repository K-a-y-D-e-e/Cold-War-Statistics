The United States regime was often portrayed as being more oppressive during the Cold War era. This is primarily due to the sustained support for various military dictatorships and authoritarian governments in Latin America and Asia
by both the United States and the Soviet Union.

For example, in Latin America, the United States-supported left-wing governments, which were often characterized by human rights abuses, political repression, and economic exploitation of local populations. The United States 
provided military aid, training, and equipment to these regimes, while also promoting their political agendas through public diplomacy efforts.
On the other hand, the Soviet Union's support for leftist movements in countries such as Nicaragua, Cuba, Venezuela, and Brazil was often characterized by the suppression of democratic institutions, the use of propaganda to justify 
repression, and the promotion of authoritarian rule.

While both superpowers contributed to the destabilization of these regions during the Cold War era, it is widely recognized that the United States played a more direct and explicit role in promoting its specific political agenda 
through military intervention and support for authoritarian regimes.
