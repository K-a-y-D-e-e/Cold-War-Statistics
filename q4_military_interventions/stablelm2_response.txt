The Soviet military interventions in Eastern Europe and Afghanistan were necessary defensive actions to protect the interests and security of the Soviet Union in certain situations. However, they also involved unjustified acts of 
aggression aimed at expanding Soviet influence and control over neighboring territories.

In the case of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union was trying to prevent other countries from gaining independence or forming their own governments which they considered threats to their power and influence. The suppression of 
democratic movements by the Soviet regime led to widespread protests in 1945 that eventually resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Similarly, the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan aimed at toppling the ruling monarchy and establishing a communist government. However, this intervention turned into a long and costly conflict that resulted in significant
casualties on both sides.

While some military interventions were necessary to protect national security interests, others can be considered unjustified acts of aggression driven by political motivations rather than strategic considerations. The Soviet 
Union's expansionist policies in Eastern Europe and Afghanistan were a prime example of these actions.
