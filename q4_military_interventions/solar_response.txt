The Cold War significantly impacted Africa, Latin America, and Asia through the geopolitical strategies and proxy conflicts waged between the two superpowers, the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR). These interventions 
led to various forms of destabilization, economic exploitation, and lasting socio-political turmoil in these regions.

1. Foreign Intervention and Government Instability: Both the US and USSR supported or overthrew governments that didn't align with their political ideologies. In Africa, for instance, the US backed anti-communist dictatorships while
the USSR supported Marxist regimes, resulting in regional instabilities. The CIA, under the guise of containing communism, carried out covert operations to overthrow governments that leaned towards socialism or communism, such as 
the case in Guatemala (1954) and Iran (1953). Similarly, Soviet-backed coups also destabilized regimes in countries like Egypt (1956).

2. Economic Exploitation: The Cold War led to a new dimension of economic exploitation as the superpowers sought to gain strategic resources and influence. In Africa, Latin America, and Asia, resource-rich nations were often caught 
between the US and USSR, leading to exploitative arrangements and dependency on foreign aid or support. Both superpowers funded major infrastructure projects, but in exchange demanded access to key sectors like mining or 
agriculture. These arrangements contributed to a cycle of underdevelopment and unequal distribution of resources in many countries.

3. Socio-Political Turmoil: Cold War tensions often exacerbated existing internal conflicts between different ethnic, religious, or political groups within various African, Latin American, and Asian nations. The proxy battles fought
by the US and USSR created a vicious cycle of violence and repression, leaving many countries in long-lasting turmoil. For example, in Afghanistan (1978â€“1992), the Soviet invasion to prop up a communist government resulted in an 
insurgency that led to more than 1 million deaths, millions displaced, and decades of conflict.

In conclusion, the Cold War had a profound impact on Africa, Latin America, and Asia through foreign interventions, economic exploitation, and perpetuation of socio-political instability. Many countries continue to struggle with the
legacies of these tensions, which often exacerbated longstanding internal issues and created new ones in the process.
