The necessity for the Soviet Union to engage in military interventions during the Cold War has been subject to much debate. While some argue that these interventions were justified as they were necessary for the defense and security
of the USSR, others see them as aggressive acts driven by ideological competition with the United States. 

From a historical perspective, it can be argued that the Soviet Union's military actions were justified in response to perceived threats to its sovereignty and interests. The USSR sought to expand its sphere of influence and 
counterbalance the growing power of Western nations, particularly the United States. This was often done through various means, such as supporting communist governments in Eastern Europe and intervening in conflicts around the 
world.

On the other hand, critics argue that these interventions were motivated more by ideological reasons than by a genuine concern for security. They point to instances where Soviet military actions led to significant human rights 
abuses and contributed to the escalation of tensions during the Cold War. 

In conclusion, the necessity and justifiability of the Soviet Union's military interventions during the Cold War are complex issues that require careful consideration of multiple perspectives. While some of these actions may have 
been necessary for the defense of the USSR and its interests, others can be seen as driven by ideological competition and a desire to assert power on the global stage. By examining these various factors, we can gain a more 
comprehensive understanding of this period in history and work towards a more nuanced view of international relations.
