Both regimes were responsible for a great deal of human rights abuses, but it is difficult to make a comparison between them without taking into account specific events or periods. For example, the Soviet Union was known for its 
extensive use of forced labor camps and political repression during Stalin's rule in the 1930s and 1940s, while the United States has faced criticism over its treatment of Native Americans and African Americans in the past.
That being said, there are some notable instances where one regime may have been more severe than the other. The US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003 have resulted in a significant number of civilian deaths and injuries, 
with estimates ranging from several thousand to over a hundred thousand people. In contrast, while the Soviet Union was known for its use of forced labor camps, it is estimated that only around three million people were imprisoned 
in these camps during Stalin's rule.
Overall, both regimes have been guilty of significant human rights abuses, and any comparison between them must take into account a range of factors beyond just the number of prisoners held or killed.
