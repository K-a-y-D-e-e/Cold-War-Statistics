The Cold War had a significant impact on Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The interventions by both the United States and the Soviet Union led to destabilized governments, economic exploitation, and enduring socio-political turmoil 
in these regions.
In Africa, the Cold War saw the United States and the Soviet Union supporting different political factions and leaders, leading to a rise in authoritarian regimes and civil wars. The economic exploitation of African resources by 
foreign companies also increased during this period, contributing to the continued marginalization of African countries in the global economy.
In Latin America, the Cold War saw the United States supporting right-wing military dictatorships, while the Soviet Union supported left-wing governments. This led to enduring socio-political turmoil and human rights abuses, as well
as economic exploitation by foreign companies.
In Asia, the Cold War saw the United States and the Soviet Union competing for influence in the region, leading to proxy wars and destabilized governments. The economic exploitation of Asian resources by foreign companies also 
increased during this period, contributing to continued poverty and inequality in many Asian countries.
Overall, the interventions by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War had a significant impact on Africa, Latin America, and Asia, leading to enduring socio-political and economic challenges in these regions.
