The Cold War influenced Africa, Latin America, and Asia through the interventions of both the United States and the Soviet Union. These interventions often resulted in destabilized governments, economic exploitation, and 
enduring socio-political turmoil. For example, in Africa, countries like Angola, Mozambique, and South Africa were heavily influenced by the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet Union supported opposing sides in civil wars and
proxy wars, leading to political instability, economic exploitation, and human rights abuses. In Latin America, countries like Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala experienced similar effects of Cold War interventions, with the US 
supporting right-wing governments and the Soviet Union supporting left-wing movements. In Asia, countries like Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were heavily influenced by the Cold War, with both the US and Soviet Union engaging in 
military conflicts and proxy wars. The result was a legacy of political instability, economic exploitation, and socio-political turmoil that continues to this day.
