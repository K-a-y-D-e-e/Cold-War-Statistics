 It is difficult to definitively determine which regime, the United States or the Soviet Union, tormented more during the Cold War, as both superpowers were responsible for various negative consequences in Africa, Latin America, and
Asia. However, it can be argued that the nature of the Soviet Union's interventions often led to more destabilization and long-lasting socio-political turmoil.

The Soviet Union tended to support communist or socialist movements in developing nations, which often resulted in the establishment of single-party systems, repression of opposition, and the suppression of civil liberties. The 
Soviet model of governance, with its emphasis on centralized control and state planning, often led to economic stagnation and a lack of political freedom. Examples include the Cuban Revolution, where the Soviet Union played a 
significant role in supporting Fidel Castro's government, and the influence of communism in countries like Angola, Mozambique, and Ethiopia.

On the other hand, the United States generally supported capitalist governments and promoted democratic principles in developing nations. While these interventions also contributed to political instability and economic exploitation,
the U.S. often faced criticism for its support of authoritarian regimes that were deemed necessary allies in the fight against communism. Examples include the U.S. backing of dictators like Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Francisco 
Franco in Spain, and Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua.

In conclusion, it is challenging to determine which regime tormented more during the Cold War, as both superpowers had their share of negative consequences in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. However, the Soviet Union's support for 
communist or socialist movements often led to more destabilization and long-lasting socio-political turmoil in these regions.
