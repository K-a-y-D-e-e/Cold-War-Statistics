It is difficult to definitively determine which regime "tormented" more during the Cold War, as both the US and Soviet Union engaged in various forms of human rights abuses and oppression. However, it is important to note that the 
extent and nature of these abuses varied across time and location.

The United States, under President Ronald Reagan, was often accused of supporting right-wing dictatorships and military regimes in Latin America, which were responsible for human rights violations, political repression, and economic
exploitation. Examples include the Pinochet regime in Chile and the Somoza family's dictatorship in Nicaragua. During the Vietnam War, the US also faced criticism for its use of napalm, agent orange, and other controversial weapons 
that caused widespread damage to the environment and civilian populations.

On the other hand, the Soviet Union, under Leonid Brezhnev, was criticized for supporting authoritarian regimes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, which were known for their suppression of political dissent and human rights abuses. 
The most notorious example is perhaps the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1979-1989), during which time tens of thousands of civilians and combatants were killed or injured due to the intense fighting and indiscriminate bombing by
both sides.

It is worth mentioning that the nature and extent of human rights abuses and political repression varied significantly across different regions, countries, and time periods. While both superpowers were responsible for causing 
significant hardship and suffering in various parts of the world, it is important to acknowledge that the impacts of their respective interventions differed in many respects.
