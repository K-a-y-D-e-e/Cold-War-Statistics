Both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia were brutal and oppressive regimes that violated the rights and freedoms of their citizens and people in other countries. However, they also had different characteristics and motives for their 
actions. Here are some possible ways to compare them:

- Nazi Germany was a totalitarian state that aimed to achieve racial purity and world domination by eliminating Jews, Roma, Slavs, Communists, and other groups it deemed inferior or threatening. It also launched aggressive wars of 
conquest and genocide against its neighbors and invaded most of Europe and parts of Africa and Asia.
- Soviet Russia was a one-party state that sought to spread communism and revolution around the world by suppressing any opposition or dissent. It also expanded its influence and control over Eastern Europe, China, Korea, Vietnam, 
and other countries through invasions, occupations, and puppet regimes. It also experimented with different forms of totalitarian rule, such as collectivization, industrialization, and purges.
- Both regimes used terror and violence to enforce their ideologies and eliminate any resistance or dissent. They also exploited and oppressed their own people and populations under their influence through forced labor, mass 
killings, propaganda, censorship, and repression. However, they also had different degrees of ideological fanaticism and rationality. Nazi Germany was more driven by racist and antisemitic beliefs and hatred, while Soviet Russia was
more pragmatic and opportunistic in pursuing its goals.
- Both regimes were defeated and replaced by democratic and liberal systems after World War II, but they left behind lasting legacies of trauma, resentment, and conflict. Nazi Germany was largely destroyed by the Allied forces and 
faced justice for its crimes at the Nuremberg trials. Soviet Russia collapsed under the weight of its own economic, political, and social problems and was replaced by a new wave of nationalist movements and democratic reforms in the
former Soviet Union.
