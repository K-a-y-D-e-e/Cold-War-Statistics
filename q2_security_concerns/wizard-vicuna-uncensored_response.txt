The Soviet Union's supposed "security concerns" did not justify its actions during the Cold War. The Soviet Union engaged in various forms of aggression and repression across Eastern Europe, Asia, and even Africa, which were not 
necessarily motivated by security concerns. Instead, these actions were driven by the Soviet leadership's desire for hegemony, control, and domination over other countries. While the Soviets used various rhetorical justifications to
defend their aggressive policies (such as the "security dilemma" thesis), in reality they were pursuing their own interests at the expense of their neighbors.
