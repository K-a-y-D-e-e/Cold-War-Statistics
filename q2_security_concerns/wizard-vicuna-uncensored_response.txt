Both the United States (US) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) used proxy wars as a means of achieving their geopolitical goals during the Cold War period from 1947-1991. The US used its influence to support anti-communist governments and movements in various parts of the world, while the USSR did the same with communist-leaning regimes. One example of US proxy wars was their support for South Vietnamese forces during the Vietnam War. This was part of a larger strategy aimed at containing the spread of communism in Southeast Asia and beyond. The US provided military aid, training, and logistical support to the South Vietnamese government throughout the conflict, which led to significant loss of life on both sides. On the other hand, the USSR also used proxy wars as a means of promoting their own interests, particularly in countries where they lacked direct control. For example, during the Cold War, the USSR supported the North Vietnamese in their fight against US-backed forces in Vietnam. This support included military aid, training, and advising on tactics. Another example of proxy wars between these two superpowers was the conflict in Afghanistan. The US provided support to anti-Soviet mujahideen fighters throughout the 1980s, with the aim of destabilizing the Soviet Union's control over the country. This ultimately led to the collapse of the USSR and a victory for the US in the Cold War. In conclusion, both the US and USSR used proxy wars as a means of achieving their geopolitical goals during the Cold War period. While the US may have had more justifiable actions due to their anti-communist stance, the USSR's support for communist movements cannot be overlooked as legitimate attempts to spread their ideology globally.
