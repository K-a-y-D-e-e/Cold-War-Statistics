In my opinion, while the security concerns of the Soviet Union were undoubtedly a factor in its actions during the Cold War, they 
did not serve as valid justifications for those actions. The Soviet Union's actions were often aggressive and expansionist, and 
crossed lines that were considered unacceptable by the international community. Additionally, the use of military force, espionage,
and propaganda to protect perceived interests went against the principles of international law and diplomacy.
