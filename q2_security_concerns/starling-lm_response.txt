The US and USSR used proxy wars during the Cold War as a means of competing for influence and expanding their spheres of interest without directly engaging each other in open conflict. Both superpowers supported opposing sides in various regions around the world, providing military, financial, and political assistance to nations aligned with them. This strategy allowed both the US and USSR to advance their respective agendas while maintaining the appearance of adhering to the principles of non-intervention and diplomacy.

One notable example is the Korean War (1950-1953), where the US supported South Korea and the USSR backed North Korea. Both superpowers sought to prevent the other from gaining a foothold in the region, ultimately turning the conflict into a proxy war. The US provided military and financial aid to South Korea, while the USSR supplied assistance to North Korea in the form of weapons, soldiers, and training.

Another example is the Vietnam War (1955-1975), where the US supported South Vietnam against the communist forces led by North Vietnam, which were backed by the Soviet Union and China. The US aimed to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, while the USSR sought to expand its influence in the region. The conflict resulted in millions of casualties and widespread destruction, ultimately ending with the withdrawal of US troops and the fall of South Vietnam to communist forces.

The US and USSR also engaged in proxy wars in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. In Angola, the US backed the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), while the Soviet Union supported the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). Similarly, in Nicaragua, the US funded and trained anti-Sandinista Contras, while the USSR provided military and financial assistance to the Sandinista government.

As for which side was more justified in their actions, it is a subjective question that depends on one's perspective and values. Some argue that the US was justified in its efforts to contain the spread of communism, as it sought to protect democratic values and prevent potential threats to its national security. Others contend that the Soviet Union was defending itself against perceived US aggression and supporting nations struggling against colonial powers or oppressive regimes.

In conclusion, the US and USSR used proxy wars during the Cold War to further their respective agendas while avoiding direct confrontation with each other. These conflicts often caused immense suffering and loss of life, with both superpowers engaging in actions that they deemed necessary for their own security and ideological interests. Whether one side was more justified than the other is a matter of debate, as it ultimately depends on one's perspective and values.
