While it is true that the Soviet Union had legitimate security concerns following World War II, particularly in light of the United States' military presence in Europe and Japan, it is important to recognize that these concerns 
were only part of a much larger picture. The Soviet Union's actions during the Cold War, such as its support for communist movements around the world, can be seen as an effort to create a buffer zone against potential Western 
aggression, but it also served to spread communism and assert its own power globally. Therefore, while security concerns may have played a role in the Soviet Union's actions, they were not the sole or even primary driver of its 
foreign policy during the Cold War.
