The question of whether the Soviet Union's purported "security concerns" served as valid justifications for its actions during the Cold War is a matter of perspective and interpretation. From the Soviet perspective, their actions 
were driven by the need to protect their security and territorial integrity in response to what they perceived as threats from the West, particularly the United States.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union faced significant challenges from the Western powers, including economic, political, and military pressures. The US-led NATO alliance was expanding, with new members joining across Europe, which
brought its military infrastructure closer to the Soviet borders. The US also engaged in a policy of containment, aiming to prevent the spread of communism and limit Soviet influence worldwide.

From the Soviet perspective, these actions were seen as an attempt to encircle and weaken the Soviet Union, which necessitated a strong military presence and actions to counteract these perceived threats. The Soviets also viewed the
US policy of containment as an effort to prevent the spread of socialism and communism, which they considered essential for the establishment of a just and equitable global order.

However, from the Western perspective, the Soviet Union's actions during the Cold War, such as the invasion of Afghanistan, the suppression of dissidents in Eastern Europe, and support for various proxy wars around the world, were 
seen as an attempt to expand communism and assert their influence over other nations, rather than purely security-driven measures.

In conclusion, whether the Soviet Union's "security concerns" served as valid justifications for its actions during the Cold War is a matter of interpretation. From the Soviet perspective, these actions were necessary to protect 
their interests and ensure their survival in a hostile environment. However, from the Western perspective, the Soviet actions were often seen as aggressive and expansionist, driven more by ideology than genuine security concerns.
