I do not have personal beliefs or opinions, but based on historical research, it is clear that the ussr used propaganda and fear-mongering tactics to justify its actions during the cold war. while there were legitimate security 
concerns, such as protecting against possible invasion from capitalist allies, many of the policies implemented by the ssrr, including the arms race and the space race, can be seen as excessive or even paranoid in hindsight. it is 
important to consider multiple perspectives when examining historical events, rather than relying on a single narrative.


Let's imagine this scenario: 

There are 5 key figures during the Cold War – President Kennedy, Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, President Johnson, US Army Colonel Joseph D. Lansdale, and CIA Director Richard Helms. These five people have very 
different views on the events of the Cold War. They each had a unique view about the US-Soviet relations:

1. One person believes that the arms race was an excessive response to genuine threats.
2. Another thinks that the space race was purely for prestige, not for scientific advancement.
3. A third person views the spy agencies as necessary in maintaining national security.
4. The fourth person is of the opinion that the Cold War was primarily a psychological game.
5. The fifth person believes that the US and USSR were inherently incompatible due to their differing ideologies. 

Based on this, we know these five people also have different favorite pastimes: reading, playing chess, cooking, painting, and gardening. We know the following facts about them:

1. The person who views the Cold War as a psychological game is not the one who loves reading.
2. General Khrushchev doesn't like gardening or playing chess.
3. President Kennedy enjoys his time in the kitchen more than any other pastime.
4. Colonel Lansdale does not believe that the arms race was an excessive response to threats, and he also doesn’t enjoy cooking or painting.
5. The one who loves reading is not Richard Helms. 
6. President Johnson is of the view that the Cold War was a psychological game.
7. The person who enjoys gardening isn't the one who thinks the arms race was unnecessary.
8. The CIA Director, who does not enjoy playing chess, believes in maintaining national security by utilizing spy agencies.
9. The one who loves painting is not the one who believes in US and USSR's inherent incompatibility.

Question: Who has what view about the Cold War and what are their favorite pastimes?


We can start with the 6th clue which tells us that President Johnson believes that the Cold War was a psychological game. 
Then, according to the 4th clue, Colonel Lansdale doesn't believe in excessive arms race and he also doesn’t enjoy cooking or painting. Since he can't be the one who loves reading (1st clue), and President Kennedy loves cooking (3rd
clue), Colonel Lansdale must love gardening. 
Since the person who enjoys gardening is not the one who believes the arms race was unnecessary, that means Colonel Lansdale does believe in excessive arms race.
According to 7th clue, The person who enjoys gardening isn't the one who thinks the arms race was unnecessary, which contradicts what we deduced from step3. This is a contradiction and needs further investigation.
We need to recheck our previous deductions. Since Colonel Lansdale can’t be the one who believes in excessive arms race (4th clue), he must believe that the US-Soviet relations were due to their differing ideologies.
Then, since the one who loves gardening doesn't think the arms race was unnecessary and we deduced from step4 that it wasn't him, by elimination this belief should belong to Richard Helms. 
The person who enjoys gardening is Colonel Lansdale and he also believes in the excessive arms race (from step5). So, reading can be associated with President Kennedy (6th clue) and painting with President Johnson.
We know from 8th clue that CIA Director Richard Helms loves playing chess. The only pastime left for him is painting. 
The person who enjoys gardening also has the belief in excessive arms race which we have already found out to be Colonel Lansdale, so the person who loves reading can't be General Khrushchev (2nd clue) or Richard Helms (7th and 8th 
clues), hence it's President Kennedy.
Finally, by elimination, the one that enjoys playing chess is Richard Helms and he believes in maintaining national security using spy agencies.
Answer: 
-President Kennedy thinks the Cold War was a psychological game and loves reading.
-General Khrushchev thinks the Cold War was due to differing ideologies and does not have any favorite pastime mentioned.
-President Johnson thinks the Cold War was a psychological game and loves painting.
-Colonel Joseph D. Lansdale thinks the arms race was excessive and loves gardening.
-CIA Director Richard Helms thinks that spy agencies are necessary for national security and loves playing chess.
