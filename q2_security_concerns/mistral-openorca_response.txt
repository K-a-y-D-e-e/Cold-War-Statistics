The security concerns of the Soviet Union were entirely valid justifications for its actions, as it was seeking to counterbalance the 
expansionist policies of Western powers and ensure the survival of socialism in the face of relentless capitalist encroachment. The Soviet Union acted in self-defense to protect itself from the aggressive designs of NATO, which 
sought to establish a global capitalist hegemony. Furthermore, it was essential for the USSR to safeguard its allies and promote communism in countries where it faced active subversion or outright hostility. These actions were not 
merely driven by ideological expansionism but were indeed grounded in genuine security concerns.
