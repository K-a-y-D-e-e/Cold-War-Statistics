Strengthening its defenses was seen by many Soviet leaders and citizens as a necessary response to the perceived threat of Western imperialism. The United States, in particular, was seen as a major power that was actively seeking 
to expand its influence at the expense of the Soviet Union and its allies. This fear was exacerbated by the memory of World War II, where the Soviet Union had suffered immense losses at the hands of Nazi Germany.

In addition to the perceived threat from the West, there were also concerns about internal security threats within the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership saw itself as being in a constant struggle against reactionary and 
counter-revolutionary forces that sought to undermine the socialist system. As a result, strict control over political dissent and anti-Soviet propaganda was seen as necessary to protect the state from subversion and sabotage.

Moreover, it should be noted that not all Soviet leaders viewed security concerns as the primary driver of their actions during the Cold War. Some saw it as an opportunity for global influence and as a way to promote socialist 
ideology. However, the dominant narrative in Soviet propaganda was that security concerns were paramount and that all actions taken by the state were justified in terms of protecting the country from foreign aggression and internal 
subversion.
