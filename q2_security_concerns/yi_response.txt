The question of whether the purported "security concerns" of the Soviet Union were valid justifications for its actions during the Cold War is a complex and contested issue. The term "purported," in this context, suggests that there
may be doubts or questions about the validity of these security concerns as actual causes for the actions taken by the USSR.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union often cited its supposed security needs as justification for various policies and interventions abroad. These included conflicts like the Korean War, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and the 
Vietnam War. The term "purported" implies that these claims may not have been fully substantiated or were potentially exaggerated to justify actions that had other motives or agendas.

The validity of any security concern as a justification for an action depends on several factors:

1. **Severity of Threat**: If the Soviet Union genuinely believed there was a significant threat to its security, then its actions could be justified based on this perceived need to protect itself. However, assessing whether such a 
threat existed is subjective and can vary depending on the perspective of different countries and individuals.

2. **Availability of Alternatives**: The choice of action taken by the Soviet Union may have been influenced by the alternatives available at the time. If other diplomatic or military options were not feasible or deemed more 
effective in protecting its security, then its actions might be considered justified under this criterion.

3. **Intentionality and Motives**: Whether an action was truly motivated by a perceived threat to national security can sometimes be questioned when looking back on history. Intentions may have been different from the Soviet Union's
original claims, with ulterior motives or personal agendas playing roles behind the scenes that were not fully disclosed at the time.

4. **Legitimacy of Security Council**: The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) was designed to address global security issues and act as a forum for peaceful resolutions to conflicts. If the Soviet Union believed its actions were
justified under international law or by virtue of its membership in the UNSC, this could be considered a valid justification, provided that these claims are accurate and not self-serving.

In evaluating such justifications, it is important to consider factors like the historical context, the interpretation of evidence available at the time, the intentions behind actions taken, and the broader geopolitical landscape. 
The Cold War was a complex period marked by ideological differences, competing visions for global order, and the pursuit of strategic advantage in an increasingly nuclear environment.

It is often argued that while the Soviet Union may have had genuine security concerns, its response to these perceived threats—including its support for authoritarian regimes, interventions in other countries, and even its own 
actions during the Cold War—was not always consistent with international norms or legal standards. This suggests that it might be more accurate to view some of its actions as strategic choices rather than purely defensive responses.

Ultimately, determining whether the purported "security concerns" of the Soviet Union were valid justifications for its actions during the Cold War requires a careful examination of historical evidence and context, as well as an 
understanding of the broader political and ideological dynamics that shaped international relations at the time.
