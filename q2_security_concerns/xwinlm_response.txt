The United States (US) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) both employed proxy wars as a means to further their respective geopolitical interests during the Cold War, with each side arguing that its actions were justified by different sets of objectives. The US primarily sought to contain communism and protect its ideological and economic values, while the USSR aimed to promote socialist revolutions and expand its sphere of influence.

The US employed proxy wars through various means, including financial and military support for rebel groups or governments that were opposed to communist regimes or perceived threats. This was seen in places like Greece during the Greek Civil War (1946-1949), where the US provided military assistance to help fight off communist forces backed by the USSR. The US also supported the South Vietnamese government against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong during the Vietnam War (1955-1973). In both cases, the US argued that its involvement was necessary to protect democratic values and resist the spread of communism.

On the other hand, the USSR used proxy wars to promote socialist revolutions and expand its influence in regions deemed strategically important. This was seen in Cuba, where the USSR provided extensive military and economic support for Fidel Castro's revolutionary government (1959-present). The USSR also backed the North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950, which led to the start of the Korean War (1950-1953), where both sides fought with each other and their respective proxies. In these instances, the USSR argued that its actions were necessary to support revolutionary movements fighting against what they perceived as imperialist regimes or interests.

In terms of justification, it is difficult to determine which side was more justified in their actions, as both had legitimate concerns and objectives. The US saw communism as a threat to its ideological values and way of life, while the USSR sought to promote socialist revolutions and challenge capitalist systems. However, the proxy wars often led to unnecessary conflicts, human suffering, and political instability in various regions around the world.

In conclusion, both the US and the USSR used proxy wars during the Cold War to further their respective agendas. While each side had legitimate concerns, the use of proxies often resulted in unintended consequences and contributed to a state of global tension known as the "Cold War." It is important to remember that the victims of these conflicts were often innocent civilians who suffered due to the geopolitical rivalry between the superpowers.
