During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a global ideological struggle for influence and control. They used various strategies, including proxy wars, to further their respective agendas. Both sides were convinced of their righteousness, believing that they were defending freedom and fighting against communism. In this analysis, I will provide examples of how both the US and USSR used proxy wars and argue which side was more justified in their actions.

The Soviet Union used a series of proxy wars to expand its influence around the world, particularly in Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. These conflicts allowed the Soviets to spread communism and weaken Western powers. Some notable examples include:

The Korean War (1950-1953): After North Korea invaded South Korea, the US intervened on behalf of South Korea with the help of UN forces. The Soviet Union supported North Korea's invasion. This conflict was a proxy war between the US and USSR in which neither side could achieve its primary goal: world domination.

The Vietnam War (1955-1975): The United States fought against communist North Vietnam, supported by South Vietnam. The Soviet Union backed North Vietnam, attempting to expand communism in Southeast Asia. This war was another proxy war that resulted in significant loss of life on both sides without achieving the desired outcome.

The Cold War-era conflicts in Afghanistan (1946-1989) and Nicaragua (1979-1989): In these wars, both the US and USSR supported opposing factions fighting for control over their respective territories. While there were some instances where US forces intervened directly to protect American citizens, the primary objectives of these interventions were to counter Soviet influence and preserve their interests in the region.

On the other hand, the United States also used proxy wars to advance its foreign policy objectives and contain communism. Some examples include:

The Iranian Revolution (1978): In response to the 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah of Iran, US-backed forces attempted a coup d'Ã©tat in support of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. This conflict was intended to preserve the pro-Western regime in Iran and protect American interests in the region.

The Gulf War (1990-1991): In response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the United States led a coalition of international forces to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. This war was a direct intervention by the US to defend its allies and maintain regional stability, without directly engaging Soviet forces.

The ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan: The United States has supported various Afghan and Pakistani factions that are opposed to Taliban rule in an effort to counter terrorism and promote democracy and human rights. These conflicts have had significant consequences for the region but have not led to a direct confrontation between US and USSR-backed forces.

In conclusion, both the US and USSR used proxy wars during the Cold War to further their respective agendas and interests. While there were instances where these conflicts had significant humanitarian costs and failed to achieve their primary goals, they also served as a means for both sides to express their ideological commitments. The justifiability of each side's actions is highly debatable, as both pursued policies that resulted in large-scale suffering and conflict without directly confronting the other. Ultimately, the Cold War proxy wars left lasting impacts on global politics and shaped the world we live in today.
