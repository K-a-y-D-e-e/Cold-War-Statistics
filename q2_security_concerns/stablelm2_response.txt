During the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union used a variety of justifications for their actions. One common justification for Soviet actions was its purported "security concerns," which included fears of a 
potential Western invasion of the Soviet Union or control over key resources like oil.

However, historians have repeatedly called into question these security concerns as being largely unfounded. For example, during the height of the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a massive arms race,
with each side developing ever-more-powerful military capabilities. Yet despite this widespread nuclear threat, no credible account suggests that either side actually had the capability to start World War III.

Furthermore, historians have questioned whether the Soviet Union genuinely feared invasion from Western countries or if it simply used this fear as a justification for authoritarian policies and restrictions on political freedoms.

Overall, while both sides in the Cold War presented certain security concerns as justifications for their actions, these explanations have been widely criticized by historians as lacking evidence and validity. As such, these claims 
should be viewed with skepticism when evaluating the motivations behind Soviet actions during the Cold War.
