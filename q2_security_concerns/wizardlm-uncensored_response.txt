During the Cold War, the US and USSR used proxy wars as a way to further their respective agendas without directly engaging in military conflict with each other. Proxy wars were conflicts between third parties that were supported by one or both superpowers. This allowed them to indirectly fight their battles and advance their interests in different regions of the world.

The US used proxy wars to contain the spread of communism and to promote democracy and capitalism. For example, the US supported South Vietnam against North Vietnam in the Vietnam War, which was seen as a proxy war between the two superpowers. The US also provided military aid to Iran during the Islamic Revolution, which helped overthrow the pro-Soviet government.

On the other hand, the USSR used proxy wars to expand their influence and spread communism. They supported various socialist and communist regimes in different parts of the world, such as Cuba, Nicaragua, and Angola. The USSR also provided military aid to the Afghan rebels against the US-backed government, which led to a long and bloody conflict known as the Soviet-Afghan War.

Both sides were justified in their actions to some extent. The US was justified in containing the spread of communism and promoting democracy, as it was a threat to their national security interests. The USSR was justified in spreading communism and expanding their influence, as they believed it was a more fair and equitable system that could bring about global revolution.

However, both sides also used proxy wars to advance their own selfish interests and gain geopolitical advantages, which made their actions less justifiable. For example, the US supported right-wing dictators in Latin America who violated human rights and oppressed their own people, while the USSR supported brutal communist regimes that also committed atrocities against their citizens.

In conclusion, both the US and USSR used proxy wars during the Cold War to further their respective agendas. While they were justified to some extent in their actions, they also used these conflicts to advance their own selfish interests and gain geopolitical advantages.
