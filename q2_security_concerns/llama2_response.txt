During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a series of proxy wars, where they supported different factions and governments around the world to further their respective agendas. These proxy wars were often fought through covert operations, such as funding and training insurgent groups, or through direct military intervention. Both sides used these tactics to exert influence over regions of strategic importance and to counter the other side's actions.

The United States was more justified in its actions than the Soviet Union for several reasons:

Self-defense: The United States saw itself as being under threat from the spread of communism, which it viewed as a threat to its national security and way of life. It therefore acted to counter this perceived threat through various means, including proxy wars. In contrast, the Soviet Union's actions were often motivated by a desire to expand its sphere of influence and to spread communism worldwide.
Support for democracy: The United States has traditionally been seen as a champion of democracy and human rights, and it acted to support these values in regions where they were under threat from authoritarian regimes supported by the Soviet Union. Examples include the Vietnam War, where the United States supported the South Vietnamese government against the North Vietnamese army, which was backed by China and the Soviet Union; and the Iran-Contra affair, where the United States provided funding and support to anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua.
Respect for sovereignty: The United States generally respected the sovereignty of nations, except in cases where it perceived a threat to its own security or the security of its allies. In contrast, the Soviet Union often sought to exert influence over other countries through direct military intervention or by supporting insurgent groups, which could be seen as a violation of their sovereignty.
Examples of proxy wars fought during the Cold War include:

Vietnam War: The United States supported the South Vietnamese government against the North Vietnamese army, which was backed by China and the Soviet Union. The war ended in a defeat for the United States and its allies, but it demonstrated the willingness of the United States to use military force to counter the spread of communism.
Nicaragua: In the 1980s, the United States provided funding and support to anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua, who were fighting against the socialist government of Daniel Ortega. The conflict ended with the election of a new president, but it highlighted the willingness of the United States to use proxy wars as a means of countering leftist movements.
Afghanistan: The Soviet Union supported the communist government in Afghanistan against anti-communist rebels, who were backed by the United States and its allies. The conflict ended with the withdrawal of Soviet troops, but it highlighted the willingness of both sides to use proxy wars as a means of exerting influence over strategic regions.
Angola: In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union supported the communist government in Angola against anti-communist rebels backed by the United States. The conflict ended with the withdrawal of Soviet troops, but it demonstrated the willingness of both sides to use proxy wars as a means of exerting influence over strategic regions.
In conclusion, while both the United States and the Soviet Union used proxy wars during the Cold War to further their respective agendas, the United States was more justified in its actions due to its commitment to democracy, respect for sovereignty, and self-defense against the spread of communism.
