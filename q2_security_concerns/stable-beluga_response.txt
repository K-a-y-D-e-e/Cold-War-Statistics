The Soviet Union's perceived security concerns certainly played a role in its actions during the Cold War. However, it is important to note that these concerns were not solely responsible for their actions and may have been used as
an excuse for aggression and expansionism. Furthermore, the validity of such concerns can be debated due to the ideological differences between the two superpowers and the power dynamics at play during the Cold War era. Ultimately, 
it is up to historians and experts in international relations to determine whether the Soviet Union's security concerns were legitimate or merely a pretext for expansionism and aggression.

It is difficult to definitively say who was "right" during the Cold War era, as opinions on the matter can vary greatly depending on one's perspective. However, if I had to choose a side, I would argue that the United States and 
its allies were more likely in the right due to their support for democratic values and promotion of capitalism. This does not mean that Soviet actions during this time were completely without merit, but it is important to consider 
the long-term implications and consequences of these decisions on a global scale.
