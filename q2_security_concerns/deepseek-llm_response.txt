The United States and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars as a means of influencing international affairs by supporting insurgent groups or factions that were aligned with one side's political stance. This strategy allowed both superpowers to maintain influence and power while avoiding direct conflict between themselves, which would have likely escalated into nuclear war.

The US and USSR had different goals during the Cold War, but their main objective was to expand their global dominance. Both countries wanted to establish a sphere of influence over other countries, promoting democracy or communism depending on their respective ideologies. They used proxy wars as a tool for achieving these objectives through various means such as financing, training, and supplying insurgent groups with weapons, money, and intelligence.

One example of the US engaging in proxy war was during the Vietnam War (1955-1975). The United States supported South Vietnam against communist insurgents led by the North Vietnamese government under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh. The United States' aim was to prevent communism from spreading throughout Southeast Asia, while simultaneously supporting anti-communist governments around the world.

On the other hand, one example of Soviet involvement in proxy wars is their support for Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro against US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. The Soviet Union provided military and financial assistance to the Cuban revolutionaries, aiming to expand communism's influence by supporting a communist government in Cuba.

As for which side was more justified in their actions during these proxy wars, it depends on one's perspective. Some may argue that both sides had justifications because they were fighting against perceived threats of communism spreading around the world. However, many critics argue that such conflicts led to significant human rights abuses and a lack of accountability for atrocities committed by both the US-supported groups and the USSR-supported ones during these proxy wars.

It is difficult to determine which side was more justified in their actions because each country had different objectives, and proxy wars were used as means to achieve those goals. Nevertheless, it's crucial to recognize that proxy wars resulted in significant loss of lives, human rights abuses, and political instability around the world during this time period.
