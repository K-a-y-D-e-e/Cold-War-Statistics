The Soviet Union's perceived security concerns did indeed play a significant role in shaping its actions and policies throughout the Cold War period. However, it is essential to consider these concerns within the context of their 
motivations and actual outcomes. The Soviet Union, founded on Marxist-Leninist ideology, sought to establish communist regimes worldwide by utilizing various means such as diplomacy, economic aid, military intervention, or 
propaganda campaigns.

Several factors contributed to this perceived need for security:

1. Expansionism: The Soviet Union was in constant expansion mode under the influence of Joseph Stalin's leadership between 1924 and his death in 1953. This pursuit led them to invade countries such as Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and China during the Cold War era. These invasions aimed at establishing 
communist governments or protecting Soviet territories from perceived threats, which was often justified through the use of national security concerns.

2. Ideological struggle: The Soviet Union viewed the United States as a capitalist superpower with expansionist ambitions and sought to counter it by promoting communism worldwide. Consequently, ideological clashes led to arms 
races, proxy wars, and espionage efforts that further fueled the Cold War's tense atmosphere. These actions were justified by claiming that they protected socialist countries from capitalist influence or threatened national 
security.

3. Containment: The United States developed a policy of containment in response to Soviet expansionism under President Harry S Truman and later Presidents during his presidency, which aimed at limiting the spread of communism 
worldwide by containing it within Russia's borders. This policy was justified by claiming that the Soviet Union posed an existential threat to global security.

4. Military build-up: The Soviet Union significantly invested in its military capabilities through massive arms race with the United States and other Western countries, which they believed were necessary for national security 
purposes. These investments included developing nuclear weapons capable of launching devastating attacks on their rivals while justifying this spending by claiming a need to protect against potential invasions or threats from 
capitalist nations.

In conclusion, it is essential to recognize that perceived Soviet Union's "security concerns" during the Cold War played an integral role in shaping their actions and policies throughout the period. However, these concerns were 
often used as pretexts for expanding influence, ideological struggle, containment of communism, and military investment rather than genuine threats from external forces. It is crucial to understand that while some historical events 
can be justified by national security concerns, such justifications should not overshadow other factors or perspectives influencing the Cold War dynamics, including geopolitical rivalry, global power dynamics, and ideological 
disagreements between competing political systems.
