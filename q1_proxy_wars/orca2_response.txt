The US and USSR used proxy wars during the Cold War to further their respective agendas in different ways. The main goal of both superpowers was to expand their influence and contain the spread of communism around the world. However, they pursued this objective through different methods and motivations.

The US relied more on direct intervention and military assistance to its allies that were threatened or invaded by communist forces. For example, the US supported South Korea after it was attacked by North Korea in 1950, and later escalated the conflict into a full-scale war against communist China and North Vietnam. The US also backed Israel in its conflicts with Arab states that were aligned with the USSR, such as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. The US justified its involvement by invoking the doctrine of containment, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism beyond a certain point.

The USSR used more indirect and covert methods to advance its interests and expand its sphere of influence. It relied on its satellite states or Warsaw Pact countries that were politically and militarily aligned with Moscow. The USSR also supported national liberation movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America that fought against colonialism, imperialism, or right-wing dictatorships. For example, the USSR helped Cuba, Angola, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia to resist external pressures and intervention from the US and its allies. The USSR justified its actions by claiming that it was defending national sovereignty and self-determination against foreign aggression.

In terms of which side was more justified in their actions, this is a matter of debate and perspective. Some might argue that the US had more moral authority to fight against communism, which they saw as a threat to democracy and human rights. They might also point out that the US intervened to protect its allies and interests, while the USSR often meddled in the affairs of other countries without their consent or approval. Others might argue that the USSR had more legitimate reasons to support anti-imperialist and anti-colonial movements, which they saw as a struggle for social justice and national liberation. They might also contend that the US often provoked conflicts by supporting oppressive regimes or intervening in civil wars.

Some possible examples of proxy wars are:

The Korean War (1950-1953), which pitted South Korea, backed by the US, against North Korea, supported by China and the USSR. The war ended in a stalemate and a truce that divided the peninsula along the 38th parallel.
The Vietnam War (1955-1975), which involved the US and its allies supporting South Vietnam against communist North Vietnam, backed by China and the USSR. The war resulted in the fall of Saigon and the unification of Vietnam under communism.
The Afghan War (1979-1989), which involved the USSR and its allies invading Afghanistan to support a communist regime that was threatened by Islamic rebels backed by the US and Pakistan. The war ended with the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the rise of the Taliban.
