During the Cold War, both the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) used proxy wars to further their respective agendas while trying to balance each other's influence around the world. However, it is important to note that the concept of "justified actions" can be subjective and depends on one's perspective or ideological stance.

Proxy wars are conflicts where one party involves third parties (proxies) in a struggle to achieve its goals without directly engaging itself. The US and the USSR used various strategies, including military interventions, economic support, political alliances, and propaganda, to shape the outcomes of proxy wars in their favor. Let's discuss some examples to understand this better:

US Interventions:
Korean War (1950-1953): The war was triggered by North Korea's invasion of South Korea, supported by Soviet advisors and Chinese volunteers. The US provided military aid and eventually led the UN forces to victory against the communist North. This intervention can be seen as part of the Cold War confrontation between the two blocs.

Vietnam War (1961-1975): The US became deeply involved in the conflict, providing financial, logistical, and military support to South Vietnam. The war led to the death of over 3 million Vietnamese and resulted in millions more refugees fleeing the country or becoming displaced persons. Critics argue that the US intervention was motivated by geopolitical ambitions rather than a genuine concern for human rights in Vietnam.

Central America (1980s): The Reagan administration's "War on Terror" included covert operations and support to right-wing guerrilla groups in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. These actions aimed to weaken the influence of communism in the region while also seeking to undermine Soviet allies.

USSR Interventions:
Afghanistan War (1979-1989): The USSR invaded Afghanistan with the intention of supporting a pro-Soviet government against Islamic insurgents. However, the war turned into a quagmire for the Soviets, resulting in over 3 million casualties and a massive financial burden that contributed to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.

Vietnam War (1968): The USSR provided military assistance to North Vietnam, including nuclear-powered submarines, aircraft, and advisors, during the American involvement in Vietnam. This support helped prolong the war for the communist side, although it also led to escalation of the conflict with the United States.

Angola Civil War (1975-2002): The USSR supported various anti-colonial movements and leftist governments in Africa, including those in Angola, Mozambique, and Ethiopia. This support often took the form of military interventions and training to resist Western influence.

In assessing whether one side was more justified than the other in their actions during the Cold War proxy wars, it's crucial to consider the broader ideological context, strategic objectives, and geopolitical realities of the time. Both the US and the USSR had their own interpretation of what was "justified" based on their perception of national security and the global struggle for influence and ideology. The outcomes of these conflicts—including the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War—also reflect broader historical trends that may or may not align with one's personal view of justice in such complex geopolitical contexts.
