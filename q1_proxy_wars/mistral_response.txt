During the Cold War, the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) engaged in various forms of competition and conflict, including proxy wars. Proxy wars refer to conflicts in which two great powers supported opposing sides without direct involvement of their military forces. Both superpowers used proxy wars as a means to further their respective agendas and expand their influence around the world.

The US and USSR employed different strategies to use proxy wars to their advantage. The US often provided military, economic, and political support to countries that aligned with its ideology or threatened by the USSR. This approach was based on the Truman Doctrine of containing communist expansion and the Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe after World War II. The USSR, on the other hand, supported communist or left-leaning movements and governments, seeking to expand its sphere of influence and weaken the capitalist world.

One significant example of US involvement in a proxy war is the Korean War (1950-1953). North Korea, a Soviet satellite state, invaded South Korea with the objective of reunifying the peninsula under communist rule. The US and its allies responded by sending troops to defend South Korea and prevent the spread of communism in East Asia. This conflict marked the first major military engagement of the Cold War and set the stage for future proxy wars.

Another instance is the Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary (1956). In October 1956, a popular uprising against the communist regime took place in Hungary. The Soviet Union, fearing the loss of its influence and potential spread of anti-communist sentiments to other Eastern European countries, sent troops to suppress the rebellion. This intervention not only restored the pro-Soviet government but also reinforced the idea that the USSR would use military force to maintain control over its satellite states.

A prominent example of US involvement in a proxy war is the Vietnam War (1954-1975). After France's defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the US provided extensive military, economic, and political support to South Vietnam against North Vietnam and its Soviet allies. This intervention aimed to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia but ultimately led to a long, costly, and unsuccessful war that significantly weakened the US' global influence.

Regarding which side was more justified in their actions, it is essential to recognize that both the US and USSR acted primarily based on their interests and ideologies rather than moral or ethical grounds. While some argue that the US had legitimate reasons to prevent communist expansion, others believe that the US' interventionism fueled instability and conflict around the world. Similarly, while some contend that the Soviet Union had a right to protect its security and expand its influence, others argue that its actions led to repression and human rights abuses in various countries.

In conclusion, both the US and USSR used proxy wars during the Cold War to further their respective agendas, and neither side can be definitively labeled as more justified. The Korean War, Hungarian Revolution, and Vietnam War are just a few examples of the complex and often detrimental consequences of these conflicts. Ultimately, these events contributed to a global power struggle that lasted for decades and significantly impacted international relations.
