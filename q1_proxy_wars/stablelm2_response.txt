During the Cold War, both the United States (US) and Soviet Union (USSR) used proxy wars as a means of expanding their respective global influence while maintaining political and military superiority over neighboring countries.

In Afghanistan, the US led a coalition against the Taliban regime in 2.001. The objective was to establish democracy and fight terrorism, which eventually led to a power vacuum that was exploited by Al-Qaeda, the militant group associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI).

On the other hand, during the Soviet-Afghan War in 1979-80, the USSR sought to establish an independent government in Afghanistan after ousting the US-supported monarchial regime. The war resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis, as over two million Afghans were displaced from their homes.

Similarly, in Vietnam, the US used the pretext of the Vietnam War (1955-75) to impose its political and economic influence on other parts of Asia. Laos and Cambodia became the "quagmire" for which American military advisors and politicians claimed credit.

On the other side, the Soviet Union relied heavily on proxy wars in Afghanistan, where it attempted to establish an independent government after ousting the US-supported monarchial regime.

In Iran, the USSR backed the Islamic Republic of Iran's (IRI) opposition to the pro-Western Shah's government. This led to a brutal crackdown by Iranian authorities against political dissent and religious minorities within the country, resulting in over one million deaths.

While both sides used proxy wars as a means of advancing their respective agendas during the Cold War, it is difficult to ascertain which side was more justified in their actions due to the complex geopolitical dynamics at play. The involvement of multiple global players, shifting alliances, and the absence of any formal agreement between the US and USSR made it challenging for anyone to maintain consistency regarding their objectives.
