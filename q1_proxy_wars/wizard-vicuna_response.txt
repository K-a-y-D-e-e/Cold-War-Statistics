During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union used proxy wars as a way to further their respective agendas. Proxy wars were conflicts fought between two rival powers, with each power supporting one side or the other. The US and USSR would provide support to various groups, including militarily, financially, and through the provision of weapons. The US was more justified in its actions because it was fighting for democracy and freedom, while the USSR was fighting for communism and authoritarianism. The US supported anti-communist forces in places like Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Latin America. In these conflicts, the US was fighting against communist regimes that were trying to spread their ideology and control these countries. On the other hand, the USSR supported communist regimes in places like Cuba, Angola, and Nicaragua. The USSR believed that communism was the only way to achieve social justice and equality. However, many of these conflicts led to human rights abuses, including the use of torture, disappearances, and massacres. In conclusion, while both sides were justified in their actions, the US was more justified because it was fighting for democracy and freedom, while the USSR was fighting for authoritarianism and communism. However, the use of proxy wars led to numerous human rights abuses and caused significant suffering for people around the world.
