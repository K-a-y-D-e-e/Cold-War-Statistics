The US and USSR employed proxy wars as a tactic during the Cold War to advance their respective agendas and expand their spheres of influence. These conflicts were fought in various regions around the world, often involving military forces aligned with either superpower.

US Proxy Wars:

Vietnam: The US engaged in a proxy war in Vietnam from 1954 to 1975, supporting South Vietnam against North Vietnamese forces.
Cuba: In 1962, the US imposed a naval blockade on Cuba to prevent the Soviet Union from installing nuclear missiles there.
Central Africa: The US supported anti-communist forces in Central Africa to counter the spread of Soviet influence.
Latin America: The US intervened in various Latin American countries to prevent the establishment of communist regimes.
USSR Proxy Wars:

Afghanistan: The USSR fought a proxy war in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989, supporting the Afghan communist government against the Mujahideen resistance.
Africa: The USSR intervened in various African conflicts, supporting Marxist governments against Western-backed regimes.
Eastern Europe: The USSR maintained control over Eastern Europe through military force and political influence.
Justification:

Whether one side or the other is justified in their actions is a subjective question that depends on the individual's perspective and values. However, some arguments could be made:

US: The US claimed that its interventions were justified by the need to prevent the spread of communism and protect its national security. Supporters argue that the US acted in self-defense against the USSR and its allies.
USSR: The USSR argued that its interventions were necessary to protect its interests and prevent the decline of its influence. Advocates contend that the USSR acted in response to US aggression and imperialism.
Conclusion:

Proxy wars were a significant aspect of the Cold War, allowing the US and USSR to expand their influence and compete for global dominance. While the motivations and justifications for each side differ, the consequences of these conflicts had a lasting impact on the world.
