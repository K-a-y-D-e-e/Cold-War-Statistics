During the Cold War, the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) used proxy wars as a means to advance their respective geopolitical interests without direct military confrontation. Proxy wars are conflicts in which two or more major powers use local forces to further their own objectives. Both superpowers sought to expand their influence, protect their allies, and contain the other's sphere of influence.

Examples of proxy wars during the Cold War include:

Korean War (1950-1953): The US backed South Korea, while the USSR and China supported North Korea. The conflict ended in a stalemate with the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone.

Vietnam War (1955-1975): The US supported South Vietnam against communist North Vietnam, which was backed by the Soviet Union and China. Despite significant US involvement, South Vietnam fell to the North in 1975.

Angola's War of Independence and Civil War (1961-2002): The US supported the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), while the Soviet Union backed the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).

Afghanistan War (1979-1989): The USSR provided military support to the communist government in Afghanistan, while the US supported the Afghan Mujahideen resistance. This conflict ended with the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the eventual fall of the communist regime.

Nicaraguan Civil War (1978-1990): The US backed the Contras, a rebel group fighting against the leftist Sandinista government, which was supported by the USSR.

Cuban Missile Crisis (1962): The Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles in Cuba, prompting a 13-day standoff between the US and the USSR, which ended with the removal of the missiles from Cuba in exchange for a US pledge not to invade Cuba and the eventual dismantling of US Jupiter missiles stationed in Turkey.

As for which side was more justified in their actions, this is subjective and depends on one's perspective. Both the US and the USSR sought to protect their interests and allies, but some may argue that the US had a stronger justification due to its support of democracy and self-determination, while others might claim that the Soviet Union was more justified in protecting its socialist allies from potential exploitation or interference by the capitalist West.

Ultimately, the use of proxy wars during the Cold War led to significant human suffering and instability in many countries. The end of the Cold War has reduced the likelihood of direct confrontations between major powers but has not entirely eliminated the use of proxy wars in modern conflicts.
