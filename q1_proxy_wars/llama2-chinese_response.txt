During the Cold War (1945-1991), the United States and Soviet Union engaged in a series of proxy wars, where both countries supported opposing sides in various conflicts around the world. These proxy wars were used by both superpowers as tools to further their respective agendas and exert influence over other nations. While both sides used similar tactics and strategies during these conflicts, the United States was generally considered more justified in its actions.

One notable example of a US-backed proxy war occurred in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War (1959-1975). The United States supported the anti-communist government of South Vietnam against the communist forces of North Vietnam, which was backed by China and the Soviet Union. While both sides suffered heavy casualties, the US and its allies were criticized for their tactics of bombing civilians and using napalm. Despite this criticism, the United States maintained that it was necessary to prevent a communist victory in Southeast Asia, and that its actions were justified in order to protect the region from falling under Soviet control.

Another example of a US-backed proxy war occurred in Nicaragua during the 1980s, when the United States supported anti-Sandinista rebels against the socialist government led by Daniel Ortega. The US was accused of providing military and economic support to the contras, who were responsible for numerous human rights abuses and terroristic acts against civilians. While the Sandinista government was also criticized for its authoritarianism, the United States maintained that it was necessary to prevent a communist victory in Central America, which would have been disastrous for regional stability and US interests.

In contrast, the Soviet Union engaged in numerous proxy wars throughout Eastern Europe during the Cold War era, most notably in Afghanistan. The Soviets provided military support to the communist government of Afghanistan against anti-communist rebels, who were supported by the United States and other Western powers. While both sides suffered significant losses during the conflict, the Soviet Union was criticized for its brutal tactics and human rights abuses, which included forced labor camps, mass executions, and bombing of civilian targets. The Soviets maintained that their actions were necessary to prevent a US-backed coup from taking place in Afghanistan, which would have been disastrous for regional stability and Soviet interests.

In conclusion, while both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars during the Cold War era to further their respective agendas, it is clear that the United States was more justified in its actions. The US was criticized for its tactics during various conflicts, but maintained that they were necessary to prevent a communist victory and protect regional stability and US interests. In contrast, the Soviet Union engaged in brutal tactics throughout Eastern Europe, which earned criticism from both Western powers and human rights organizations. While both sides used similar tactics, the United States was generally considered more justified in its actions during this era of conflict.
