During the Cold War (1947-1991), the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) engaged in a series of proxy wars as part of their geopolitical strategies. Proxy wars are conflicts where one or both major powers support opposing sides in a local conflict without direct involvement of their own armed forces. This approach enabled them to expand their influence, undermine their adversary's power, and further their respective agendas without escalating into open conflict between the superpowers.

Both countries justified their actions by claiming they were protecting national security interests and defending ideologies against the perceived threat posed by the opposing side. The justification for each side's actions can be evaluated based on various proxy wars.

Korean War (1950-1953): Both the US and USSR provided military, financial, and political support to North and South Korea respectively. While the US justified its involvement in terms of containing communism, the Soviet Union argued that they were supporting a movement for national liberation from colonial powers.

Vietnam War (1954-1975): The US supported the South Vietnamese government against the North's communist forces, seeing it as part of a broader containment strategy to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, the USSR and its satellite states provided support to North Vietnam as part of their efforts to aid national liberation movements resisting foreign-imposed regimes.

Cuban Revolution (1953-1959): The US supported Fulgencio Batista's dictatorial regime against the revolutionary forces led by Fidel Castro, eventually leading to Batista's ouster in 1959. After the revolution, the Soviet Union began providing extensive support to Cuba, which became a communist state and a significant thorn in the side of US foreign policy.

Afghanistan War (1979-1989): The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to prop up a friendly government under threat from Islamic insurgents. This led to a massive backlash, with the US funneling funds and weapons through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency to support the Afghan Mujahideen rebels against the Soviet-backed regime.

The justification of each side's actions can be evaluated based on their stated intentions and broader historical context. While it is true that both superpowers claimed to defend national security interests, some arguments suggest that the US was more justified in its actions. The Truman Doctrine (1947) and the Domino Theory (1954), which argued that if one country fell to communism, neighboring countries would follow suit, provided a framework for US containment policy. This led the US to support anti-communist forces during proxy wars.

However, it is also important to note that the US had historically interfered in other nations' affairs to further its own interests and supported authoritarian regimes. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union itself was initially founded on an ideological revolution against foreign powers that sought to control Russia. The USSR's actions were partly driven by a desire to protect the gains of their revolution and spread the socialist/communist model.

In conclusion, while it can be argued that both sides used proxy wars as tools to further their agendas during the Cold War, evaluating which side was more justified in their actions is subjective and depends on one's interpretation of the historical context and principles driving each superpower's actions.
