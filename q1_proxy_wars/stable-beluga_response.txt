During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union utilized proxy wars as a means of exerting influence and expanding their spheres of influence without directly engaging each other. Proxy wars involved providing military, economic, or diplomatic support to one side in an ongoing conflict, thereby indirectly supporting one's own interests.

The US used proxies as a means of counterbalancing the Soviet Union's geopolitical influence and expanding its sphere of democratic influence worldwide. One example was the Vietnam War, where the US provided military support to South Vietnam against North Vietnam, which was backed by the USSR.
The Soviet Union also used proxies in order to counterbalance the United States' global influence and promote communist ideology throughout the world. For instance, Cuba was a key proxy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, with Moscow providing military assistance and economic support.
Both sides used proxies to advance their geopolitical interests without direct confrontation or escalation of conflict between themselves. This strategy allowed them to avoid direct warfare and maintain a state of global tension that ultimately benefited both nations.
As for which side was more justified in its actions, it is difficult to determine a clear winner. Both the United States and Soviet Union supported their proxies for strategic reasons. However, if we were to examine the impact on civilians and human rights during these conflicts, it may be argued that the US had a cleaner record as they avoided direct military involvement in many of the proxy wars, focusing instead on supporting local forces fighting against Soviet-backed regimes.
