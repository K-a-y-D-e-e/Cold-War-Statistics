During the Cold War, both the United States (US) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) used proxy wars as a strategy to advance their global agenda without direct military confrontation with each other. This policy involved supporting friendly governments or insurgency groups in conflict zones around the world that were either allied to one side or the other, or had the potential to be swayed towards it.

The US and USSR used proxy wars for several reasons:

Avoid direct confrontation: Engaging in proxy wars allowed both sides to avoid a direct military clash between their respective superpowers, which would have risked a catastrophic nuclear conflict.
Containment of the enemy's influence: Supporting friendly forces or insurgency groups provided a means to limit the other side's influence in strategic regions and prevent it from expanding its control or sphere of influence.
Ideological competition: Both sides were driven by a desire to promote their respective political systems (capitalism for the US, communism for the USSR) as the superior global model. Proxy wars served as an arena to test and demonstrate the strengths of each system, often with humanitarian consequences for the local populations caught in the crossfire.
Economic interests: Control over strategic resources such as oil, minerals, and trade routes were at stake in several proxy wars, which further fueled their involvement in conflicts around the globe.
Examples of US and USSR proxy wars during the Cold War include:

Afghanistan (1979-1989): The US supported the Afghan Mujahideen against the Soviet Union's occupation, which eventually led to the latter's withdrawal in 1989. The conflict was a significant factor in the eventual collapse of the USSR in the early 1990s.
Angola (1975-1991): The US supported the UNITA rebel group against the pro-Soviet MPLA government, while the USSR provided military and financial aid to the MPLA. This conflict prolonged the civil war and led to significant human suffering.
Nicaragua (1979-1990): The US supported the Contras, a rebel group opposed to the socialist Sandinista government, which received arms and support from the Soviet Union and Cuba. The conflict caused massive displacement and human rights abuses in the country.
Vietnam War (1955-1975): The US intervened in the Vietnam War in support of South Vietnamese governments against North Vietnam, which was supported by the USSR and China. This conflict resulted in millions of casualties and significant environmental damage.
In terms of justification for their actions, both sides often cited self-defense and protecting their allies as their primary reasons. The US argued that it had to counteract Soviet expansionism, while the USSR claimed that its interventions were to protect communist governments or movements from capitalist aggression. However, critics argue that the proxy wars caused immense human suffering, disruption of civil societies, and contributed to the proliferation of weapons and destructive ideologies. Ultimately, it can be argued that neither side's actions were morally justified, as they led to a global arms race, increased geopolitical tensions, and fueled conflicts in many regions worldwide.
