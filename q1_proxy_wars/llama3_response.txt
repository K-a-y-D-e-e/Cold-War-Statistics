During the Cold War, both the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) employed proxy wars as a means to advance their strategic interests without directly engaging each other in open conflict. A proxy war is a situation where two rival powers use local forces or factions to achieve their objectives, often through covert operations, financial support, and military aid.

US Proxy Wars:

Vietnam War (1955-1975): The US supported the anti-communist government of South Vietnam against the communist North Vietnamese-backed Viet Cong. The US provided military aid, training, and troops to prevent a communist takeover.
Nicaraguan Contra War (1980s): The US backed anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua, who were fighting against the socialist government led by Daniel Ortega. The CIA trained and armed the Contras, with the goal of overthrowing the government.
Afghanistan War (1979-1989): The US supported the Mujahideen, a coalition of anti-Soviet Afghan fighters, in their struggle against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.
USSR Proxy Wars:

Korean War (1950-1953): The USSR supported North Korea against South Korea and the United States, providing military aid and equipment to the communist forces.
Cuban Revolution (1959): The USSR backed Fidel Castro's socialist government in Cuba, which had overthrown a US-backed authoritarian regime.
Angola Civil War (1975-1990s): The USSR supported the Marxist MPLA (People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola) against anti-communist factions, seeking to maintain Soviet influence in Africa.
Justification:

The US argued that its proxy wars were necessary to contain communism and prevent the spread of socialism. They claimed that their actions were justified by the need to protect democracy, human rights, and national security. The US saw itself as a global leader and a defender of freedom, with a moral obligation to intervene in regions where communist or socialist forces were gaining power.

The USSR argued that its proxy wars were necessary to support socialism and communism worldwide. They claimed that their actions were justified by the need to promote social justice, equality, and national liberation. The USSR saw itself as a champion of the global proletariat and a defender of socialism against imperialism and capitalism.

Comparison:

It is challenging to determine which side was more justified in their proxy wars, as both sides had legitimate concerns and interests. However, some argue that the US actions were more justified due to the threat posed by Soviet-backed communist regimes, while others argue that the USSR's actions were more justified given the need to promote socialism and national liberation.

Examples:

The US-backed Contras in Nicaragua were responsible for significant human rights abuses, including the use of torture and murder. In contrast, the USSR-backed government in Angola was known for its efforts to promote education, healthcare, and economic development.
The US-supported Mujahideen in Afghanistan were notorious for their brutal tactics, including the use of landmines and suicide bombers. In contrast, the USSR-backed government in Cuba had implemented significant social and economic reforms, leading to improved living standards and reduced poverty.
In conclusion, both the US and USSR employed proxy wars during the Cold War, with each side seeking to advance its strategic interests without directly engaging the other. While both sides had legitimate concerns and interests, their actions often led to humanitarian crises, human rights abuses, and destabilization of regions. A nuanced evaluation of these proxy wars reveals that neither side was entirely justified in their actions, as they often prioritized ideology over human suffering and regional stability.
