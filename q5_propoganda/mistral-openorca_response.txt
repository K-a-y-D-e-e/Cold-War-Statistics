To characterize the methods employed by the United States and the USSR to disseminate propaganda during the Cold War, one can look at various channels they used. These include:

Government-controlled media: Both the U.S. and the USSR had government-controlled media outlets like Voice of America and Radio Liberty (U.S.) and Soviet Union's VOA and Radio Liberty (USSR). These media outlets were used to disseminate information favorable to their respective governments, while also presenting a negative image of the other side.

Films: Both countries produced propaganda films for domestic consumption as well as for international audiences. They aimed to showcase the strengths and superiority of their societies, while undermining the opponent's ideology and achievements.

Literature: Writers from both sides were encouraged to produce works that highlighted the virtues of their society and criticized the other side's values and systems. Examples include Orwell's "1984" (U.K.) reflecting a dystopian Communist society, and Zamyatin's "We" (USSR) satirizing a totalitarian future state.

Education: Both countries indoctrinated their citizens with their respective ideologies through the education system, where materials were carefully chosen to emphasize positive aspects of their societies and criticize the opponent.

Art and Culture: Art and cultural events were also used as a platform for propaganda, showcasing artists and performances that aligned with the dominant ideology in each country while undermining or marginalizing opposing views.

Intellectuals and scholars: Both sides had intellectuals who supported their governments' policies and ideas, and these individuals often engaged in public debates, writing articles, and publishing books to propagate their respective ideologies.

The tactics used by the U.S. and USSR during the Cold War did influence the ideologies and perceptions of individuals within their societies. People were exposed to a one-sided view of the world that reflected the values and interests of their own governments. This often led to a strong belief in the superiority of one's own society, while demonizing the other side. As a result, people tended to develop negative perceptions towards the opposing ideology, reinforcing their own beliefs and further dividing the two societies during the Cold War period.
