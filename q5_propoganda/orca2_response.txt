One possible answer is:

Propaganda is a form of communication that aims to persuade or manipulate an audience by appealing to their emotions, beliefs, values, or prejudices. Propaganda can be used for various purposes, such as promoting a political agenda, justifying a war, or suppressing dissent.

During the Cold War, the United States and the USSR employed different methods of propaganda to project their ideologies and influence the perceptions of their respective populations. Some of the main techniques used by both sides were:

Mass media: The US and the USSR used various forms of mass media, such as radio, television, newspapers, magazines, books, posters, and movies, to disseminate propaganda. They produced and distributed content that promoted their values, principles, and achievements, while criticizing or undermining those of their adversary. For example, the US funded and supported independent media outlets in Eastern Europe and Asia, while the USSR did the same in Latin America and Africa.
Psychological warfare: The US and the USSR also engaged in psychological warfare, which is a type of propaganda that aims to exploit the emotional or cognitive vulnerabilities of an audience. They used various strategies, such as disinformation, misinformation, deception, intimidation, blackmail, or sabotage, to create fear, mistrust, anger, or resentment towards their opponent. For example, the US spread rumors and false information about the USSR's nuclear capabilities, while the USSR claimed that the US was secretly supporting terrorist groups around the world.
Cultural diplomacy: The US and the USSR also used cultural diplomacy, which is a type of propaganda that aims to promote their culture, arts, sciences, or sports as a symbol of their superiority or influence. They organized and sponsored cultural exchanges, festivals, exhibitions, performances, or competitions, to showcase their achievements, values, and lifestyle, while contrasting them with those of their adversary. For example, the US supported the spread of jazz, blues, rock and roll, and Hollywood movies around the world, while the USSR promoted the works of writers like Maya Angelou, Langston Hughes, or Ernest Hemingway, and composers like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, or Sergei Prokofiev.
Educational exchange: The US and the USSR also used educational exchange, which is a type of propaganda that aims to influence the minds and hearts of future generations by sending students, teachers, scholars, or experts to study or teach in their respective countries. They provided scholarships, grants, awards, or recognition, to entice or attract potential recruits, while offering them opportunities for learning, networking, or personal growth. For example, the US offered the Fulbright Scholarship program, which allowed thousands of students and scholars from around the world to study or teach in the US, while the USSR offered the Lenin Scholarship program, which did the same for students and scholars from its satellite countries.
The extent to which these tactics influenced the ideologies and perceptions of individuals within their respective societies depended on several factors, such as:

The effectiveness and credibility of the propaganda messages
The availability and accessibility of alternative sources of information
The level of education, literacy, and awareness of the audience
The degree of conformity, resistance, or indifference of the audience
The presence or absence of social, economic, or political incentives or pressures
The prevalence or decline of other forms of communication or entertainment
Therefore, propaganda was not a uniform or consistent phenomenon during the Cold War, but rather a diverse and dynamic one, that varied across time, space, and context. Propaganda also had different impacts and outcomes, depending on who was producing it, who was consuming it, and what was their goal, motive, or intention.
