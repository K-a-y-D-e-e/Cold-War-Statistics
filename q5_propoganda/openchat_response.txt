During the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union employed various methods to disseminate propaganda in order to promote their respective ideologies and undermine the other side. These methods can be characterized as follows:

State-controlled media: Both superpowers controlled their domestic media outlets, ensuring that they served as mouthpieces for the official line. In the USSR, the government owned and controlled all major newspapers, radio stations, and television networks. Similarly, in the United States, the government used its influence over broadcasting licenses to encourage compliance with its propaganda efforts.

External broadcasting: The US established the Voice of America (VOA) in 1942 to provide news and information to audiences behind the Iron Curtain. The Soviet Union countered with the creation of Radio Moscow, which targeted Western audiences. These broadcasters aimed to shape public opinion in target countries by presenting their governments' perspectives on global events.

Cultural diplomacy: Both superpowers used cultural exchange programs and educational initiatives to promote their ideologies. The US Information Agency and the USIA (predecessor of the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs) sponsored various programs, including academic exchanges, artistic performances, and exhibitions, to showcase American values and culture. The Soviet Union likewise organized cultural events, sports competitions, and educational exchanges to promote its image and ideology.

Infiltration and subversion: Both sides engaged in efforts to influence foreign governments and societies through infiltration of political parties, labor unions, and other organizations. This included covert operations like the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) efforts to overthrow foreign governments perceived as unfriendly to US interests and the KGB's support for communist movements worldwide.

Espionage and propaganda: Both superpowers engaged in espionage activities, using intelligence agencies like the CIA and the KGB to gather information on each other's intentions and capabilities. This information was often used to create propaganda campaigns aimed at undermining the enemy's image or influence.

To what extent did these tactics influence ideologies and perceptions within their respective societies? It is difficult to measure the exact impact of these tactics, as people's beliefs are influenced by a complex interplay of factors. However, it can be said that the propaganda efforts of both superpowers contributed to the polarization of public opinion during the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet Union were portrayed as irreconcilable adversaries, with each side demonizing the other's ideology and system of governance. This perception shaped the attitudes of citizens within their respective societies, with many people adhering to their government's official line and viewing the other side through a lens of suspicion and hostility.
