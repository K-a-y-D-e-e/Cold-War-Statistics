There are different ways to approach this question, but one possible response is:

The Cold War era had a profound impact on education and academia around the world, especially in the context of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. Both superpowers sought to promote their ideological and political agendas through their educational systems, as well as to advance their scientific and technological capabilities. As a result, the Cold War shaped curriculum development and research agendas in various ways, such as:

The promotion of American values and institutions, such as democracy, capitalism, human rights, and free markets, through educational programs and materials that emphasized these aspects over others. For example, the Fulbright Program, which funded exchange students and scholars across borders, was seen as a way to foster cultural diplomacy and intellectual exchange between the US and its allies, while also countering Soviet influence in regions such as Europe and Latin America.
The suppression of alternative viewpoints or dissenting voices that contradicted the official stance of either side on various issues, such as socialism, communism, nuclear disarmament, or human rights violations. For example, many Eastern European universities were subject to Soviet control and censorship, while many Western universities faced pressure from the US government to conform to its foreign policy objectives. Additionally, some fields of study that were deemed unpatriotic, subversive, or ideologically incompatible with the Cold War narrative were either discouraged or denied funding and resources by both sides.
The competition between the two superpowers for scientific and technological superiority, which stimulated a race to develop new innovations and breakthroughs in various fields, such as space exploration, computing, biology, medicine, and defense. For example, the US launched the Apollo program, which aimed to land humans on the moon by the end of the 1960s, while the Soviet Union developed the Sputnik satellite, which marked the beginning of the space race in 1957. Both programs required massive investments and resources from their respective governments, as well as a close collaboration between academia and military institutions.
The influence of political considerations on the selection of research areas during this period, which often prioritized topics that were relevant to national security, economic competitiveness, or ideological propaganda over those that were purely academic or scholarly. For example, the US government funded a lot of research in the fields of nuclear physics, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence, which had potential military applications and implications for the Cold War balance of power. Similarly, the Soviet government supported research in the fields of rocketry, space exploration, and biotechnology, which aimed to demonstrate their achievements and capabilities to the rest of the world.
Overall, the Cold War era shaped education and academia by imposing a global context of ideological conflict, political rivalry, and technological competition that influenced the content, quality, and direction of academic work in various ways. Both sides sought to use their educational systems as instruments of soft power, cultural influence, and scientific innovation, while also facing challenges and limitations imposed by the other side's countermeasures. Therefore, it can be argued that the Cold War era had both positive and negative effects on education and academia, depending on one's perspective and interests.
